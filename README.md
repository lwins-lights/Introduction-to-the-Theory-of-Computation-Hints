# Introduction-to-the-Theory-of-Computation-Hints (Solutions)

This project is supposed to eliminate _all_ difficulties in solving problems in Michael Sipser's _Introduction to the Theory of Computation (3rd Edition)_. Generally speaking, it does not include those problem answered in the book.

We highly recommend you to see these hints as _last resort_, because you will _not_ benifit much from simply reading these hints unless you have tried really hard to solve those valuable problems.

## Notice for Contributors

You are welcome to contribute to this project by creating a pull request. 
Generally speaking, your solutions are not necessary to be detailed, so long as they have included all nontrivial key steps. 
Any solution having essentially difference with existing ones would be quite valuable. 

* Once you make some contribution to this project, you can add your name or pseudonym to the author list.

* You can claim the ownership of your solution by using pre-defined command `\Attr{[your name]}` (refer to Problem 6.16). 
	If it is not an original solution, you must use this to indicate whom the solution is attributed to.
	
* Use command `\Sol{}` for the case there are mutiple solutions for a same problem (refer to Problem 8.24).
